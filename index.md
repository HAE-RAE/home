## HAE-RAE (해례) 

<img align="right" src="assets/logo.png" width="35%" height="35%">

HAE-RAE is a non-profit research community focused on the interpretability and evaluation of Korean language models. Our mission is to advance the field with insightful benchmarks and tools. Founded in May 2023, we have published widely used benchmarks ([HAE-RAE Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02706) and [KMMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11548)) and are contributing to push Korean LLM research.
 
Our name originates from the commentary on the "Hunminjeongeum," the original promulgation of the Korean script Hangul, reflecting our deep connection to the Korean language and culture.

At HAE-RAE, we are committed to openness, collaboration, and excellence in our research endeavors. We actively seek opportunities to engage with the wider research community and welcome feedback and partnerships that align with our mission.
